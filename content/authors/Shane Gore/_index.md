I am a researcher working at the interface of biomechanics and data science. My research to date has largely focused on the biomechanics of injury, utilizing 3D motion capture technologies, wearable sensors, and leveraging data analytics to uncover meaningful insights from the data.

I have experience in the design, implementation, and supervision of research projects, along with the communication of complex findings in a clear and effective manner to a wide variety of audiences.
